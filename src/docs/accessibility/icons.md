### Icon fonts vs SVGs
Icon fonts have the best advantage when it comes to asset control, backwards compatibility and ease of development. However, since it is a font - it can have rendering issues and anything that fonts may have issues with. Alternatively the better solution would be SVGs, especially for accessibility but they come with added complexity.
