## Recommendations

### Familiar color usage for clickable
Sharing the same color denotes shared interactive quality. So if links and buttons are both the same blue - blue is clickable by shared association. 


## Avoid
### Avoid very high contrast
Very high contrast can diminish readability for some users. It is advisable to slightly temper the contrast between your paragraph text and background color. My recommendation would be to try to keep it between 7-8 contrast.
