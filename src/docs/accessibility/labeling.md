## WCAG 4.1.2 Criterion, Name, Role, Value
For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies. (Level A)

## Recommendations
### Icon only situations can have hidden span for screen readers
Using the utility **.visually-hidden**, we can add context to our button. 
``` html
<button>
  <svg><use xlink:href="#navicon"></use></svg>
  <span class="visually-hidden">menu</span>
</button>
```

### Use aria-label 
This attaches alternative text to elements much like alt attribute. It also has the benefit of overriding the text node of the element. This can be useful when the description of the icon like "right-pointing triangle" can be replaced with "play". 
``` html
<button aria-label="menu">
  <svg><use xlink:href="#navicon"></use></svg>
</button>

<!-- reads 'menu' instead of 'trigam for heaven' -->
<button aria-label="menu">
  &#x2630
</button>

```
