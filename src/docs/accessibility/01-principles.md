## Design with code
Designing only for aesthetics can only lead to inaccessibility

## Inclusive interfaces are robust interfaces
Different technologies can fail but your interface will stand

## 100% accessibility compliance can still be unusable
Do not focus only on the box-ticking

## Content makes or breaks accessibility
The perfect code cannot make up for confusing content

## Your users are anyone human
Regardless of your personas, accessibility is for everyone
